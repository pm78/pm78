# Hi, I’m Pascal (@pm78) 👋
CRO in **Payments / Fintech** • Builder of **agentic AI** systems • Coach (HEC Paris) • Marathoner

I like turning messy enterprise problems into **shippable products**—especially where **AI + data + customer experience** meet. Outside work, I’m deep into **cognitive performance** (biohacking, neurofeedback, HRV/sleep tracking) and I run a small **vertical farm** at home 🌱

## What I’m focused on right now
- **Agentic AI / RAG**: corpus engineering, contextual retrieval, reranking, evals, multi-agent workflows
- **Sales & customer experience automation**: knowledge → answers → proposals → next-best-actions
- **Neurofeedback experiments**: Python tooling around signals, feedback loops, coaching-grade UX

## Tech I use
- **Python** (FastAPI, data pipelines, LLM orchestration)
- **LangGraph / LangChain** (agent workflows & tooling)
- **Vector search** (embeddings, metadata filters, chunking strategies, rerankers)
- **React / TypeScript** (when a UI needs to exist)
- **Git / Docker / CI** (because “it runs on my laptop” doesn’t count)

## Open to collaborating on
- Practical **agentic AI** products (RAG, orchestration, evaluation, reliability)
- **Neurofeedback / cognitive training** apps (signal processing + product thinking)
- Tools that kill boring manual work (I’m allergic to admin 😄)
